# Question 1
###Complete definitions for Scrum related key terminology provided below
# SCRUM CEREMONIES
# ·        Product backlog refinement
### Product backlog refinement is also known as product backlog grooming this is what keeps the backlog updated and in order and starts at the end of sprint and is a collaborative discussion process. This where it is decided if the backlog is prepared for the next backlog.
# ·        Sprint planning.
### This is where you and your scrum team come together in a meeting with the objective to establish what you want to accomplish this sprint. This meeting can be long as we have to understand what each team member is going to do assigning tasks and establishing what the expectations are for the team and each individual.
# ·        Daily scrum.
### This is also known as a stand-up meeting. that is normal short but important and described as to the point. These meetings are in the morning. It is important was established, what each person done the day before in meeting goals and what they plan to do today. Each individual speaks up on a call or ‘stands up’ meaning they address the team and discuss this.
# 
# ·        Sprint review.
### This meeting is done once a sprint is completed. This is where you communicate about everything good and everything that can be improved and things not to do again. It is to gather feedback and have open conversations and create support teamwork. This is review allows for future sprints and team environments to be supportive.
# 
# ·        Sprint retrospective
### This meeting also occurs at the end of a sprint. It focuses on improving the overall system. Sprint retrospective allows the tram to evaluate past working cycle. It allows the team to gather feedback and work on what they can do in future.
# SCRUM ROLES
# ·        ScrumMaster
### The ScrumMaster is a leader the ‘master’ of the scrum. They have the role to create an effective and productive working environment. The ensure there is good communication and collaboration. The scrum master does this to ensure a positive outcome of the scrum. 
# ·        Product Owner
### The product owner is a role in a scrum team who is responsible for product backlog. They represent the user and owner and collaborate with the customer to define features. They are also responsible for a successful outcome of project
# ·        Development Team.
###  The development team in scrum is the individuals involved in delivering a product at the end of a sprint. These individuals are different professionals, cross functional team of people they have all the skills necessary to build the product increment. They are organised and manage their own work, they are self-organizing. 


# Question 2
##You are leading a development team that was given a task to create a new yoga booking system.
#
## High level description of the system is as follows:
#
##·        It has a very simple interface to accept user input (bookings) and display classes information
## ·        All bookings, appointments, schedules etc should be stored in a SQL database.
## ·        There is a ‘backend’ system that should be written in Python to handle the logic and manage the data flow.
## Your team has two weeks to build a simple prototype that will be shown to the client to seek their feedback and discuss further enhancements.
# TASK
## ·        Break this task into smaller stories (chunks of work) for the team to work on.
## ·        Assume that one person works on one task.
### Agile- is a methodology, a way of working. It is how you approach a task. 
### Using Agile methodology, I am going to describe how I would approach this task that I am leading to create a new yoga booking system. Agile is the new way of working as it works in iterations and allows you work with the client and customers gaining feedback. In two weeks, my team will show the simple prototype to the client to seek their feedback and discuss further enhancements. 
## REQUIREMENTS
### In our team we will set out requirements as part of Agile-
### We need individuals outlining the requirements of the task and creating a requirements documentation.
### Requirements mean outlining what the goals are of the task. This needs to direct and straight to the point. There needs to be good communication and sharing of ideas and collaboration. 
### For this task, it is the requirement of user input. So, it is important that the requirements outline the goal for this yoga booking system are to create a yoga booking system that allows user input. 
### We need to create user stories to layout who is going to do what and why they are going to do it. User stories are when all the scenarios of the user is involved. Then the user acceptance test is where the user stories such as the features are walked through and tested. This is outlined in the requirements.
### Every individual is involved in the requirements stage from software developers to project managers.
### So, for this task my team and I can write down some requirements of our project then get started straight away after assigning tasks to individuals on the design and development of the booking system.
# 
# DESIGN
### After the requirements planning the product manager and designer in my team can work to figure out the design from visual to interactive design and code. They will work on important problems to solve and adding design and engage with development team. This is done in time for feedback in two weeks with client. The main ideas are put into the project after brainstorming in the planning and requirement stage. Their goal in my team is to validate the business case and make sure the engineering team's time is well spent solving actual problems that actual customers face.
### For this task, you start by creating and designing simple user interface. You can also make plans for future designs for when the project is complete to share with client and gain feedback. For example, color schemes and name of booking system.
### Having a user story in mind we can create a design for this task that team focused on solving a real user’s problem. Such as, login design when signing into booking system and profile displaying booked appointments and options for cancellations of appointments and changing booking. Having a real user in mind these design aspects are easier to deal with.
### One individual can work on the profile design and another on the main home page. Whereas two other individuals can work on the design of the features of booking, cancelling, and changing. 
## DEVELOPMENT
### This is the step-by-step breakdown of tasks for each individual in the team that needs to be worked on. 
### Assuming that each individual works on one task. One individual will work on the user input. This means creating the code to create the prompts for user inputs. This means planning and writing down the code for the different user inputs and handling the different possibilities for the different user inputs to outline information such as classes and their booked classes. To handle the different times the user chooses on each day or the same day as well as the user input for classes. 
### We also need individuals working on the data storage and backups to SQL.
### We need one individual working in the SQL database to allow new user input into a new clients database on SQL. This individual needs to create queries to allow the data inserted in the user input into a new client’s data. This means when a user creates a new account using sign up this creates a new client in SQL database. 
### Another individual needs to create all the appointments available each day. For example, the appointment’s available each day for the next month. 
### Another individual needs to handle the queries to the SQL database for when a user selects an appointment or multiple appointments in one day or multiple dates they no longer show up as available. 
### Another individual needs to manage all the user data that is now client data by checking for errors and ensuring the system is up to date and there is no bugs.
### This individual needs to be assessing what works and what does and making note of it and communicating to the team. But also putting things into place to fix them. Manage the SQL database so it does not break.
### Smaller tasks include individuals handling the backend solely. This is done in Python to handle the logic and manage the data flow.
### This means there need to one individual working on the backend allowing for there to be new users to be created in the backend once gaining the user input on the front end after signing up. This then need to be saved and information such as password encoded to the backend using JSON. 
### Another individual needs to work on the logic to display each user’s information such as appointments and bookings.
### Lastly there needs an individual that manage the data flow. This means this individual works on retrieval and receiving of data to be working successfully. That the backend is connected to the database and the frontend. This individual needs to work on the API connection between SQL database and the python backend ensuring we can insert, delete, and update.
# 
## TEST AND FEEDBACK
### This outlines what needs to be tested and also breaks down what needs to be done and by who. 
### We need to test user input . This means checking user story, does each user input effective and what does each user input allow access to and do.
### For example, signing in allows users to enter booking system and see list of appointments. But incorrect sign in will not allow users to that page. This needs to be tested and checked if it works. Creating a user story of signing in we came up with the creative solution that only signing with the correct information will your profile and booking system be shown. 
### Individual(s) working on SQL database need to be assess what works and what does and making note of it and communicating to the team in the SQL database. This tests the system and ensures everything is working as it should as outlined in requirements. But also putting things into place to fix them. Manage the SQL database so it does not break.
## ·        Mark tasks that can be worked on in parallel and perhaps those that need to be worked on in particular order.
# 
### With agile you are expecting changes and so the meeting in two weeks is beneficial to adding requirements from feedback of client. You don’t need a lot to start initial planning of task using agile. So, this stage is normally done in the beginning but it does not require a lot so you can always add to it and do it parallel to design and development and testing always adding and changing. In waterfall you cannot start until everything is planned out but agile is not as strict. You can do some initial planning and get started straight away with designing and creating and writing code.
### With design this can and often should be done first. This is because you need to create user interface and start initial planning of the project. So, for this yoga booking system we can create the design of homepage and the decide on some initial features. But we can work alongside and parallel to the SQL database. So, if the database is not completed, we can still start designing the yoga booking system as it doesn’t depend on anything.

# TASK 2 (SQL)
# 
## Question 1
## Design a cinema booking system.
## Think how you would approach the problem and what are potential ways of solving it?
### You do not need to write actual code, but describe the high-level approach:
# ·        Draw a list of key requirements
#### Every user can book a movie to watch
#### There are different options for movies to book 
#### You can book more than one movie on one day and book movies on other days
#### You can book movies in advance
#### You can book multiple movies in advance on one day and multiple movies in advance on separate days 
#### No limit to booking movies
#### There needs to be age restriction on certain movies
#### Booking is open for fixed period of time before session is timed out, e.g., book within 15 minutes of clicking movie to book 
#### When movie is booked, booking details are available to view.
#### Copy of booking is sent to email
#### Allow for users to login 
#### Allow users to access profile 
#### Show multiple movies out now and available to watch
#### Show times and dates movies are on 
#### Show age restriction to each movie has and ensure when booking individual are asked for ID if movie requires it
#### For example, when booking movie for 18+ to show ID online or when ticket is given in the cinema clerks need to check ID 
#### Show when movies will stop showing
#### Show different genres of movies
#### Show when next movies are going to come out
#### Show locations of cinema and details of emails and number of cinemas to contact
#### Outline rules and restrictions e.g., must have mask on when entering specific cinema and throughout watching film before booking individuals need to accept terms
#### Ask for user feedback of using app – allowing user interactions 
#### Show food and drinks available to book online
#### Allow multiple items or food and drinks to be clicked and bought for each user
#### Show available and unavailable seats in movie 
#### Showing seating plan and allow user to click specific seat if available
#### Allow group bookings
#### Provide link to show trailer to movie
#### Allow discounts and promotions on movie bookings and food and drink
#### Show upcoming movies coming out, dates and times and movie blurb
#### Support high traffic
#### Reporting system
#### Booking movie depends on payment
#### So must accept payments for booking the movie(PayPal, Apple Pay, Direct debit)
# ·        What are your main considerations?
#### Design- How to make the app look, user interface
#### Usability- is it easy to use 
#### Technology- is the right technologies used to allow the app to work in the best way
#### Security- is the information security handled effectively 
#### Quality- is there consistency in quality of the design and the service
#### Performance- is it working in good speed and accuracy
#### Layout and language(s)- does it have an easy to follow and use layout and does the app do it in multiple different languages
#### Functionality- is the app functioning in exactly the way you want and need it, such as backend functionalities
#### Features- does it have allow the important features such as user input
#### Experience- does the app ensure a good user experience, adding feedback from comments to improve on
#### Efficiency- is the app efficient 
# ·        What would be your common or biggest problems?
#### If there is multiple movie bookings, is memory of the cinema booking system going to be able to deal with it
#### Is there backup memory?
#### Internet drops or if app reboots will the booking be lost 
#### Buffering
#### Viruses or system bugs
#### If this app works on multiple devices such as mobiles and computers.
#### If you cannot view your booking at the end
#### Payment security
#### Profile such as name and address, password security- overall user security data confidentiality and data breaches 
# 
# 
# ·        What components or tools would you potentially use?
#### Back up data for each user
#### Machine learning for recommendations for users based on previously booked movies working with AI
#### Python could be used for the backend
#### API created with Flask
#### User friendly interface to show movies that are on now
#### A database such as SQL database to store data on movies and retrieve data on the movies and users and cinema
#### Storing everything on cloud and not locally for memory 
##### ·        You are welcome to draw a diagram (a very simple one) for the process flow to explain how  it is going to work.
