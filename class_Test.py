# CODING CHALLENGE :muscle:
# FIND THE THREE LARGEST NUMBERS
# Write a function that takes in some array of at least 3 integers  and returns an array of the
# 3 largest integers in this input array.
# Caveat:  implement this function WITHOUT SORTING the input array. You cannot sort, you can ONLY TRAVERSE.
# Hint: can you keep track of the three largest numbers in  our array as you traverse the input array?
# This is a team challenge and each team will present their approach EVEN IF IT IS NOT READY.
